## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/522939786395254785/1125529481969401886/image.png?width=327&height=169)

Macro Num Pad is a very basic but versatile little template I created for turning your more than likely untouched numpad into a macro pad hence the name obviously.

It's very easy to use and quick to set up, I'll be adding examples as well for those with less coding knowledge and those who need help!

## Built With

This was all made with AHK and only AHK, I will not be giving any EXE files so as I know some are very untrusting

## Getting Started

Starting off you wont need install near anything. 

In the future if you want to set up graphics to display certain things when changing profiles or when certain actions are done using this, a program like rainmeter would be a good idea as well!

### Prerequisites

Auto Hot Key v2 -
**(optional for experienced users)** Rainmeter

### Installation

[Auto Hot Key Download](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe)
[Rainmeter Download](https://github.com/rainmeter/rainmeter/releases/download/v4.5.17.3700/Rainmeter-4.5.17.exe)
